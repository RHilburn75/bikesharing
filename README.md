# bikesharing
## Project Overview
To explore the possibilities of opening up a bike sharing in Demoines, we will analize data from New York Citibike.  We'll be using data visualization tools to provide a summary of our findings

## Resources
- Data Source: Citi Bike Data, 201908-citibike- tripdata.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.7, Anaconda Navigator 1.9.12, Conda 4.8.4, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3, Tableau Public

## Results

## Module Work

 - 2.3 million rides in August
 - 81% users were subsribers
     - 65% were males
     - 25% were females
     - 10% unknown
     
 - Top riding locations are:
     - Touristic areas
     - Busy areas or districts

### August Peak Hours

 - Highest activity - 5pm - 7pm.  This will require the need for the most bikes to be ready
 - 2am - 5am.  Prime time to perform bike maintenance.

 - 7am - 9am for rush hour going to work
 - 4pm - 7pm coming home for the evening
 - Notice - There is a high number of commutes in the morning on Wednesday's.  However, it's the lightest commute of the week.

## Summary
The results show that most of the bike sharing is in Manhatten, during the 7am - 9am rush hour and the 4pm - 7pm commute home. Also included in this day=ta is tourism.  There are also some increase on the weekend which is due to tourism.  This is a popular and widely used area of transportation for workers and commuters.
Additional analysis would be helpful in coming to a decision
 1. Weather data to see the impacts of using bikesharing
 2. Male Bicylces used in comparison to femaile bicycles.  Comfort could increase business.
 3. Business month to month and tract trends
 4. Extend to the suburbs or borrough's
